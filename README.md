# Marimo Notebook Exploration

This project demonstrates the features and capabilities of **Marimo Notebook**, a reactive Python notebook that simplifies interactive programming. The notebook showcases how Marimo can be used to create dynamic applications, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and host interactive notebooks on the web.

---

## Features Highlighted in This Project

1. **Reactive Programming**:
   - Marimo automatically updates outputs when UI elements like sliders or dropdowns are modified.
   - Example:
     ```
     slider = mo.ui.slider(1, 22)
     mo.md(f"Slider value: {slider.value}")
     ```

2. **Automatic Import Suggestions**:
   - When a required library (e.g., `numpy`) is missing, Marimo detects the issue and provides options to add the import or install the package directly.

3. **Direct Package Installation**:
   - Install missing packages with a single click using options like `pip` or `poetry`.

4. **Interactive Dashboards for DataFrames**:
   - A single line of code generates a detailed dashboard for exploratory data analysis.
   - Example:
     ```
     df = pd.read_csv("cars.csv")
     ```

5. **Hosting Notebooks**:
   - Host notebooks on Marimo Cloud with custom domain names for easy sharing.
   - Example link: [Static Notebook](https://static.marimo.app/static/psdv4-0lyt)
