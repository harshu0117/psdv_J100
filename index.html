    <pre><code>
    import altair as alt
    import vega_datasets
    
    # Load dataset
    cars = vega_datasets.data.cars()   
    # Create a scatter plot
    chart = alt.Chart(cars).mark_point().encode(
        x='Horsepower',
        y='Miles_per_Gallon',
        color='Origin'
    )   
    # Make the chart reactive
    chart = mo.ui.altair_chart(chart)
    </code></pre>
    
    <p>This approach simplifies creating real-time, interactive visualizations, making it ideal for data exploration and analysis.
